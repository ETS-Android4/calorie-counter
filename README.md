# calorie-counter
An android app that estimates calorie content of food items using deep learning.

This project is an android studio app thus the source code
runs on Android studio only.

Main Tools Used
1. Java 11
2. Fat Secret API
3. TensorFlow

Consider the following:
1. Do NOT update gradle nor update dependencies as some
of my source code sections rely on early versions of
tensor and other APIs
2. The target API should remain 28
3. You may install the demo apk. It is a release version
that I built and signed. 
4. Project only runs on JDK 11, do not use any other
